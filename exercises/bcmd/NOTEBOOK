In this exercise I was first trying to get the total RAM and print to the screen.
But soon realized that this was a very difficult task that probably wouldn't fit
in the 512 bytes of the bootloader.
So I decided to mess with video memory to see what I could do. With this idea in 
mind, I implemented a function called drawSmiley, that takes x and y as an input
and draws a smiley in that location (x and y can only be 1 character long). It 
also uses the x and y location to style the smiling face with a color and back-
ground.
